### Single leg take down (Giancarlo Bodoni, Lucas Lepri)

1. Break opponents grip
2. Two-on-one on opponents arm (strong grip on biceps and stron pull)
3. Snatch opponents leg as they pulls back (Gable grip to protect wrist)
4. Switch one grip around opponents back
5. Drop your inside knee and base out (or lock his back leg with your forward leg if u can)

If 2. doesn‘t work because opponent put elbow on your neck:
3. Push elbow by and drop your opposite knie on the ground
4. Switch one grip around opponents back
5. Drop your inside knee and base out (or lock his back leg with your forward leg if u can)

**Principles:**

Constant driving force (keep your opponent always hopping)
Minimize space in between (head close to opponent → no chance for guillotine)
