# Statistic tools

### t-test
-parametric test
-comparing means
-normally distributed assumpation


### Mann–Whitney U-test (= Wilcoxon Rank sum test) 
-is a version of the independent samples t-test that can be performed on quantitative or ordinal (ranked) data. 
-Comparing medians
-non-parametric
-underlying populatins not normal but similar shapes
-H0: Populations are the same

### concordance probability (c-index) (Harrell et al., 1996; Pencina and D’Agostino, 2004)

### area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Chambless and Diao, 2006)

### The use of ROC for defining the validity of the prognostic index incensored data
Petra Wolf, Georg Schmidt, Kurt Ulm

-If there is no censoring, c-index and AUC are identical and equate the Mann–Whitney statistics P ( X > Y ) .
-it is shown that Harrell’s concordance index does not meet the Mann–Whitney statistic under censorship (Koziol and Jia, 2009).
-the concordance index uses survival time as response whereas the AUC uses the binary endpoint event/no event at or up to a given time point
-The Mann–Whitney parameter on the other hand compares two survival curves instead of comparing subjects with events and subjects without event.
-cut point to differentiate between subjects with high risk, who e.g. should get a treatment and patients with low risk for which a treatment is not essential. To enable a clinician to make such a decision, measures like **sensitivity and specificity** are useful tools. The information given by a c-index or an AUC alone is not sufficient. Third another useful information can be found in the **time dependence of the AUC**. Is the prognostic ability the same over the complete observation time or is the marker only a good measure for some extent of time?
