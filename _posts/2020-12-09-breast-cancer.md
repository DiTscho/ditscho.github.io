# Genes from hybrid signature

1. **GAS7** Growth arrest-specific 7. Expressed in differentiated **brain cells**. Annotations related to this gene include **actin filament binding**.
2. **CCT6B** Chaperonin-Containing-T-Complex Polypepdtide 1, Subunit 6B. Part of chaperonin-containing complex (**heat shock proteins**). The complex folds various proteins including **actin and tubulin**.
3. **LAMA2** Laminin, Alpha 2. Extracellularv protein and major component of the **basement membrane**. Mediates attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues.
4. **DNAJB9** DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member B9. This gene is a member of the J protein family. J proteins function in many cellular processes by regulating the ATPase activity of 70 kDa **heat shock proteins**. This gene is a member of the type 2 subgroup of DnaJ proteins. The encoded protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays a role in protecting stressed cells from **apoptosis**.
5. **CLIC6** Chloride Intracellular Channel 6. May insert into membranes and **form chloride ion channels**. May play a critical role in water-secreting cells, possibly through the regulation of chloride ion transport. Diseases associated with CLIC6 include Deafness, Autosomal Recessive 102 and Febrile Seizures, Familial, 5. Among its related pathways are Activation of cAMP-Dependent PKA and Neuropathic Pain-Signaling in Dorsal Horn Neurons.
6. **ARHGEF5** Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 5. Strongly activates RHOA (PubMed:15601624). Also strongly activates RHOB, weakly activates RHOC and RHOG and shows no effect on RHOD, RHOV, RHOQ or RAC1 (By similarity). Involved in **regulation of cell shape and actin cytoskeletal organization** (PubMed:15601624). Plays a role in actin organization by **generating a loss of actin stress fibers and the formation of membrane ruffles and filopodia** (PubMed:14662653). Required for SRC-induced **podosome formation** (By similarity). Involved in positive **regulation of immature dendritic cell migration**.
7. **SORCS2** Sortilin Related VPS10 Domain Containing Receptor 2. This gene encodes one family member of vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain-containing receptor proteins. **Plays a role in the regulation of dendritic spine density in hippocampus neurons** (By similarity). Required for normal neurite branching and extension in response to BDNF (PubMed:27457814). Plays a role in BDNF-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Together with NGFR and NTRK2, is required both for BDNF-mediated synaptic long-term depression and long-term potentiation (PubMed:27457814). ProNGF binding promotes dissociation of TRIO from the heterodimer, which leads to inactivation of RAC1 and/or RAC2 and subsequent reorganization of the **actin cytoskeleton** (PubMed:22155786). Together with the retromer complex subunit VPS35, required for normal expression of GRIN2A at synapses and dendritic cell membranes. Required for normal expression of the amino acid transporter SLC1A1 at the cell membrane, and thereby contributes to protect cells against oxidative stress (By similarity)
8. **ADAMTSL2** This gene encodes a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) and ADAMTS-like protein family. Members of the family share several distinct protein modules, including a propeptide region, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TS) motif. Individual members of this family differ in the number of C-terminal TS motifs, and some have unique C-terminal domains. The protein encoded by this gene lacks the protease domain, and is therefore of a member of the the ADAMTS-like protein subfamily. **It is a secreted glycoprotein that binds the cell surface and extracellular matrix; it also interacts with latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 1. Mutations in this gene have been associated with geleophysic dysplasia**. 
9. **ACTN1** Alpha actinins belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents a diverse group of **cytoskeletal proteins**, including the alpha and beta spectrins and dystrophins. Alpha actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in different cell types. In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it is involved in **binding actin to the membrane**. 
10. VOL16A1. This gene encodes the alpha chain of type XVI collagen, a member of the FACIT **collagen family** (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted helices). Members of this collagen family are found in association with fibril-forming collagens such as type I and II, and serve to **maintain the integrity of the extracellular matrix.** High levels of type XVI collagen have been found in fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and in smooth muscle and amnion.  
11. **KLRB1** Killer Cell Lectin Like Receptor B1. Natural killer (NK) cells are **lymphocytes that mediate cytotoxicity and secrete cytokines after immune stimulation**. Several genes of the C-type lectin superfamily, including the rodent NKRP1 family of glycoproteins, are expressed by NK cells and may be involved in the regulation of NK cell function. **The KLRB1 protein contains an extracellular domain with several motifs characteristic of C-type lectins, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain**. The KLRB1 protein is classified as a type II membrane protein because it has an external C terminus.
12. **POLR2D**. This gene encodes the **fourth largest subunit of RNA polymerase II**, the polymerase responsible for **synthesizing messenger RNA** in eukaryotes. In yeast, this polymerase subunit is associated with the polymerase under suboptimal growth conditions and may have a stress protective role. A sequence for a ribosomal pseudogene is contained within the 3' untranslated region of the transcript from this gene. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates.
13. **ENC1**. Ectodermal-Neural Cortex 1. is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with ENC1 include Intracortical Osteogenic Sarcoma and Diverticulitis Of Colon. Among its related pathways are WNT Signaling. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include **actin binding**. This gene encodes a member of the kelch-related family of actin-binding proteins. **The encoded protein plays a role in the oxidative stress response as a regulator of the transcription factor Nrf2, and expression of this gene may play a role in malignant transformation.** Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
