Escape_of_Human_Breast_Cancer_Cells_from_a_Microtumor_to_an_Empty_Cavity]

- What properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important for cells to invade?
- The **ECM pore size**, rather than elastic modulus or interstitial flow speed.
- 3D microfludic culture of MDA-MB-231.

## OncoType DX: A Multigene Assay to Predict Recurrence of Tamoxifen-Treated, Node-Negative Breast Cancer

- Predict likelihood of distant recurrence of ER+ patients with no involdved lymph nodes
- RT-PCR of 21 genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue -> RECURRENCE SCORE

## EndoPredict: A New Molecular Predictor of Distant Recurrence in ER-Positive,HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Adds Independent Information to Conventional Clinical Risk Factors

- predict likelihood of distant recurrence in ER+, HER2- patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy
- RNA expression
- 8 cancer-related genes of interest (GOI: BIRC5, UBE2C, DHCR7, RBBP8, IL6ST, AZGP1,
MGP, and STC2) and 3 normalization genes (CALM2, OAZ1, and RPL37A).
- ESR1/ERBB2 gene expression to set IHC
- EPclin = EP + tumor size + nodal status

## Comparison of EndoPredict and EPclin With OncotypeDX Recurrence Score for Prediction of Risk of Distant Recurrence After Endocrine Therapy

- distant recurrence in ER+, HER2- patients. 
- EP and EPclin are better than OTdX.

## Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others

- OPTIMA population with ER+ patients used to compare molecular subtyping and gene signatures.
- All test provide similar risk information in general. 
- Individualy, risk categorization differ.

## MammaPrint versus EndoPredict: Poor correlation in disease recurrence risk classification of hormone receptor positive breast cancer

- 48 representative primary tumors analized
- EP and MP cannot be used interchangeably

## The nucleus measures shape changes for cellular proprioception to control dynamic cell behavior 
Valeria Venturini et.al.

- Nucleus translates cell changes into a deformation signal by regulating cell behavior!
- In presence of deformation higher levels of myosin II are observed.
- Cell behavior was associated with the nucleus stretching and unfolding of the inner nuclear membrane (INM).
- INM triggeres calcium-dependent mechanotransduction pathway (via the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2))
- Experimental setup: confinement and squeezing of cells.

## The nucleus acts as a ruler tailoring cell responses to spatial constraints
A. J. Lomakin et.al.

- Nucleus provides cells presize measure of deformation.
- If compressed to the size of nucleus, the nuclear envelope (NE) unfolds.
- Contractile forces start when the NE is unfolded.
- This mechanical change releases Calcium from nuclear memrane.
- Calcium activates the calcium-dependent phospholipase (cPLA2).
- cPLA2 is an enzyme that acts as a sensor of the nuclear membrane tension and it regulates signaling and metabolism.
- Down the road, omega-fatty-6 acids and myosin II are activated.
- Finally, this induces contractility of myosin cortex.
