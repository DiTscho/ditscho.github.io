## Deep learning OS

- Show that biomechanical profile changes with time: RNA-seq
- Hans knows whom to send
- Morphological profile of malignant cells is broader
- No sense to measure means, medians, etc, since they do not account for tails
- Optimze algorithm
- Erik will send me 3 different images of resting cell for all cells
