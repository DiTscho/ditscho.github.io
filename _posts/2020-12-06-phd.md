- Overexpression of group II phospholipase A2 in human breast cancer tissues is closely associated with their malignant potency

## Deep learning OS

- Show that biomechanical profile changes with time: RNA-seq
- Hans knows whom to send
- Morphological profile of malignant cells is broader
- No sense to measure means, medians, etc, since they do not account for tails
- Optimze algorithm
- Erik will send me 3 different images of resting cell for all cells

## How to write a scientific paper 

1. don't procrastinate;
2. review the notes and renew the literature search;
3. determine who your audience is - most likely reviewers, so get their concerns firstly addressed;
4. create the outline and get the big picture done, i.e., complete the first draft while resisting the temptation to correct and edit as you go; the logical sequence of data/tables/figures may be the outline; while writing the first draft, take notes indicating what references might be needed and would be about, but don't stop to collect the references;
5. begin with the easier part of the task - experimental section rather then the introduction; then follows the results and discussion section;
6. then comes the really hard part - critical editing where you make sure that the English is coherent and the science is correct; 
7. write the conclusion in a numbered format;
8. then comes the abstract and the acknowledgements;
9. now comes the introduction, the two most important things to address in which are the purpose and relevant background;
9. then collect the references.

Some final notes:
1. always check the manuscript requirements for the journal of interests.
2. a few references on writing. Please refer to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7sVKJPTMA
