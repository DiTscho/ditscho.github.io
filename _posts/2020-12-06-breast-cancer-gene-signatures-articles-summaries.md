## OncoType DX: A Multigene Assay to Predict Recurrence of Tamoxifen-Treated, Node-Negative Breast Cancer

- Predict likelihood of distant recurrence of ER+ patients with no involdved lymph nodes
- RT-PCR of 21 genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue -> RECURRENCE SCORE

## EndoPredict: A New Molecular Predictor of Distant Recurrence in ER-Positive,HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Adds Independent Information to Conventional Clinical Risk Factors

- predict likelihood of distant recurrence in ER+, HER2- patients treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy
- RNA expression
- 8 cancer-related genes of interest (GOI: BIRC5, UBE2C, DHCR7, RBBP8, IL6ST, AZGP1,
MGP, and STC2) and 3 normalization genes (CALM2, OAZ1, and RPL37A).
- ESR1/ERBB2 gene expression to set IHC
- EPclin = EP + tumor size + nodal status

## Comparison of EndoPredict and EPclin With OncotypeDX Recurrence Score for Prediction of Risk of Distant Recurrence After Endocrine Therapy

- distant recurrence in ER+, HER2- patients. 
- EP and EPclin are better than OTdX.

## Comparing Breast Cancer Multiparameter Tests in the OPTIMA Prelim Trial: No Test Is More Equal Than the Others

- OPTIMA population with ER+ patients used to compare molecular subtyping and gene signatures.
- All test provide similar risk information in general. 
- Individualy, risk categorization differ.

## MammaPrint versus EndoPredict: Poor correlation in disease recurrence risk classification of hormone receptor positive breast cancer

- 48 representative primary tumors analized
- EP and MP cannot be used interchangeably
